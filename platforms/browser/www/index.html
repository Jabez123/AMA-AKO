                      <strong>AMA Institute of Computer Studies</strong> <br>

AMA University and its sister school AMA Computer College (AMACC) were founded by Dr. Amable R. Aguiluz V, who named them after the initials of his father's name, Amable Mendoza Aguiluz, Sr. Dr. Aguiluz saw the demand for fully trained computer professionals in the country. However, no institution in the country offered computer education to professionals.

Aguiluz founded the AMA Institute of Computer Studies with the first computer school located along Shaw Boulevard on 20 October 1980. At that time, AMA Institute of Computer Studies offered only short-term courses in Electronic Data Processing Fundamentals, Basic Programming, and Technology Career. Three student enrolled at the AMA Institute of Computer Studies during the first semester.
<br><br><strong>AMA Computer College, branches and sister schools</strong> <br>AMA Computer College came into existence in June 1981. It extended its services through a four-year Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. With only a handful of students in its first year of operation, the AMACC student population rose dramatically from 600 in 1983 to 2,000 in 1985 in its first official campus in Makati City. Shortly after, it established its main campus in Quezon City. Two provincial campuses were then founded in Cebu and Davao City.

With the passage of the Philippine Republic Act No. 7722 or the Higher Education Act of 1994, privately controlled educational institutions' academic fees were deregulated. AMA increased tuition fees then solved the problem of low student population by embarking on a marketing, advertising and information campaign.

The emergence of AMACC led to the birth of AMA Computer Learning Center (ACLC) in 1986 and AMA Telecommunication & Electronic Learning Center in 1996. The former offers short-course programs for professionals and two-year technical/vocational courses for those who wish to acquire employment skills. The latter is one of the first schools in the Philippines to concentrate on telecommunication, electronics, and related technologies.

It was the first school in the country to fully integrate the Internet into its curriculum. Since 1987, all major AMA colleges have been interconnected through a local area network (LAN), which converted them into one nationwide school system.

In 1991, Aguiluz gained accreditation for AMA Computer College in the American League of Colleges and Universities (ALOCU), thus, making AMA the first Filipino and non-American school to do so. AMACC became an official member of the John F. Kennedy Educational Institute in Japan. AMACC is accredited by the National Computing Centre United Kingdom.
